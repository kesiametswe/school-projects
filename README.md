## brief descriptions of project
Since I have lost all the formal technical documentation for the projects, below are summaries for the projects.

### 1) [Math Game PAT - Grade 10 (2022)](Paul_PAT/src/itPat_mathGame/ITPat_mathGame.java)

#### summary
A simple maths game is created using java message dialog boxes as an interface for user input and processed output. Users choose between 3 levels (beginner, intermediate, expert) and which operations (addition, subtration, multiplication, division) they would like to test. Scores are kept to determine the message displayed in the message box upon completion of the level. The user has the option to exit the program or play again at the end of the game.


First project in Java which demonstrates my ability in:
- Mathematical calculcations in Java
- Input validation and Error Handeling
- Basic OOP principles
