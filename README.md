# school-projects
All my major high school information technology (IT) projects created between 2022 - 2024 which demonstrate my proficiency in Java and SQL.

## brief descriptions of project
Since I have lost all the formal technical documentation for the projects, below are summaries for the projects.

### 1) [Math Game PAT - Grade 10 (2022)](https://github.com/kesiametswe/school-projects/blob/main/Paul_PAT/src/itPat_mathGame/ITPat_mathGame.java)

#### summary
A simple maths game is created using java message dialog boxes as an interface for user input and processed output. Users choose between 3 levels (beginner, intermediate, expert) and which operations (addition, subtration, multiplication, division) they would like to test. Scores are kept to determine the message displayed in the message box upon completion of the level. The user has the option to exit the program or play again at the end of the game.

#### First project in Java which demonstrates my ability in:
- Mathematical calculcations in Java
- Input validation and Error Handeling
- Basic OOP principles

### 2) [Wordle clone PAT - Grade 11 (2022)](https://github.com/kesiametswe/school-projects/tree/main/PAT2023Kesi)

#### summary
A [semi-successful] attempt at reproducing the infamous Wordle game in Java. Users can create accounts using the Java UI which are then stored in a MS Access database and simply login thereafter. A class (User.java) temporarily stores user data (games played, password, username highscore etc) to sent to above mentioned database. A .csv file containing 500 4 letter words is called randomly select a 4 letter word for the user to guess. The correct letters in incorrect positions and correct letters in correct positions are marked to guide the user. 

_the project is only "semi-successful" because integration of the SQL database and Java application failed and so did the "restart game" function as the previous lettering does not always clear unless one exits and re-runs the programme._
 

#### This project demonstrates my ability in:
- Intermediate OOP theory implementation through multiple class usage
- User validation and verification methodologies
- SQL database management (.accdb)
- File importation and manipulation (.csv)
- Class importation and integration
- Java UI interface design
- Integration of backend and frontend classes

### [UN Sustainable City Creation Tool](https://github.com/kesiametswe/school-projects/blob/main/PAT_Kesi_2024_085034.zip)

_folder was too large to upload at one go. So, due to pure laziness, I just zipped it and uploaded it_
